Steps to run program:
=====================
1. In the base directory, run 'make' in a terminal. This will compile the executable for the program.
2. cd to the 'output' directory.
3. In the 'output' directory, run './a.out <number of threads> <input size>' in the terminal to run the program. If these 
	parameters are not specified, or an unexpected number of parameters are input, the program will prompt the user to
	automatically run the predefined number of threads and input. The program will then automatically run and output items for
	different numbers of threads using 1000000 randomly generated integers for each iteration.

NOTE: A debug file (named debugLog.log) can be viewed in the 'output' directory to see output from the programs execution.
