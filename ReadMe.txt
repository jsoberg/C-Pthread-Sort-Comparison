Steps to run program:
=====================
1. In the base directory, run 'make' in a terminal. This will compile the executable for my program.
2. cd to the 'output' directory.
3. In the 'output' directory, run './a.out' in the terminal to run the program.

The program will automatically run and output items for different numbers of threads using 1000000 randomly generated
	integers for each iteration.
